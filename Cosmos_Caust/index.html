      <h2>Personal & Passionate (Behind-the-Scenes)</h2>
      
      <h3>Our Story</h3>
      <p>
        Gate of Aurora began with a simple idea: what if the experiment fought back? What started as concept sketches and narrative notes has evolved into a full-fledged action platformer that channels our love for games like Hollow Knight, Dead Cells, and Blasphemous.
      </p>

      <h3>Why We're Making This</h3>
      <p>
        Because we believe in games that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Make you feel powerful yet vulnerable</li>
        <li>Tell stories through gameplay, not just cutscenes</li>
        <li>Respect player skill and reward mastery</li>
        <li>Create worlds you want to explore, even when they're dangerous</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Meet the Vision</h3>
      <p>
        Led by Mabuyo, our small but passionate team combines expertise in pixel art, level design, and narrative construction. We're not just developers—we're gamers who understand what makes an action platformer truly unforgettable.
      </p>

      <h3>Join Our Journey</h3>
      <p>
        Gate of Aurora is still in development, and we're excited to share this journey with you. Follow our progress, provide feedback, and be part of creating something special.

      <h2>The Origin of Vengeance</h2>

      <h3>Backstory</h3>
      <p>
          Once an ordinary teenager, he was **abducted** and forced into a cruel experiment designed to push the boundaries of human evolution. Stripped of his freedom and humanity, he became nothing more than a lab rat for the scientists' twisted ambitions. After years of relentless modifications, the experiment reached its climax. His fragile body was **reforged with machinery**, his veins pumping with cold synthetic power.
      </p>
      <p>
          Though the scientists celebrated their "success," he saw only betrayal. His humanity was stolen, his youth sacrificed, his future rewritten into steel and wires. Consumed by rage, he attempted to strike down the very man who orchestrated his torment, which is **his creator**. But he was overpowered, discarded like broken equipment, and cast into the depths of the underground ruins, a place where failed experiments rot and forgotten machines linger.
      </p>
      <p>
          Down there, surrounded by shadows and echoes of other abandoned projects, his anger hardened into purpose. He vowed that one day, he would rise again, tear through the robotic legions guarding the laboratory, and **exact his revenge**. He would not rest until his creator felt the same pain of destruction that he had endured.
      </p>

      <h3>Mission</h3>
      <p>
          Fight your way back to the laboratory and **confront your creator**. Along the path, swarms of robotic enforcers, failed experiments, and automated defenses stand in your way, each one programmed to stop you from reaching the surface.
      </p>
      <p>
          Every enemy you dismantle brings you closer to vengeance, but also reveals fragments of the truth: why you were chosen, what the true goal of the experiment was, and the terrifying scale of the scientist's plan. Your mission is not just to kill your creator but to **reclaim your stolen humanity**, or destroy what remains of it.
